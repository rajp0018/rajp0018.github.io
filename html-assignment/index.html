            <h2>About_myself</h2>
            <p>This is Vedansh from IMD ,group-1 . I am from India and i love exploring new things. I am a music producer and I am still exploring different genres. My favourite type is <abbr title="Electronic Dance Music">EDM</abbr>. This genre became my favourite since i started listening to Avicii a.k.a Tim Bergling. He has been one of the biggest influencer in my life. I also love to walk and sprint and stay active.

            </p>
            <p>My favouite thing is to dream about the good life in future , i like living in <em>fantasy world</em> sometimes. i could'nt get a chance to attend my 12<sup> th  </sup>the whole year due to covid. I miss the time because i would've had fun with my friends because high school is the best time of a teenagers life. Its kind of a regret that it could've been the most precious time of my life.</p>
